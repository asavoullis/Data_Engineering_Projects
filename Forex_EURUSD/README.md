# Forex EUR/USD Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview

In this data engineering project, I've focused on the analysis and preparation of financial (forex) data. The project involves tasks such as data loading, cleaning, transformation, and analysis to ensure the dataset is ready for various data analysis, machine learning, or reporting tasks.

## Project Structure

- **eurusd_hour_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with a step-by-step walkthrough of the data engineering project, covering data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning feature preparation.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for usage.
- **DataSet**: Where the csv raw data are.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

The project provides insights into the financial dataset, explaining the significance of each column and addressing anomalies in the data, such as trading activity for 6 days a week instead of 5. It also includes checks for null and zero values, ensuring data quality.
